Introduction to SwagLabs Test Framework
Testing Tool: Selenium
Report: Extent
Our team has developed the SwagLabs Test Framework to advance the automation and testing capabilities of web applications. This framework integrates Selenium for web automation, leveraging its robust capabilities to simulate user interactions effectively. Complementing Selenium, Extent Reporting serves as our chosen tool for comprehensive test reporting. It provides detailed and interactive reports crucial for monitoring test execution and promptly identifying issues.
Key features of our framework include a data-driven approach, facilitated through XML files that define diverse test cases. This approach enhances flexibility and scalability in testing scenarios, accommodating varied inputs and ensuring robust application testing.
